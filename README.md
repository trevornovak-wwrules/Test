Feature: AI Assistant - Daily Schedule Summary
Feature Overview
This feature will enable a mobile technician to ask the AI Assistant for a summary of their scheduled day and receive a concise, natural language overview of their key appointments and tasks. 

Motivation/Problem Statement
Currently, technicians must manually review their schedules, which can be inefficient and difficult while on the move. This feature directly addresses the technician's need to "seamlessly access summaries of my day" to be "fully prepared, work more efficiently, and provide expert, personalized service to every customer." 


Acceptance Criteria/Requirements
[ ] A technician can trigger the daily summary using a natural language voice or text command (e.g., "What does my day look like?", "Summarize my schedule"). 


[ ] The AI-generated summary must accurately reflect the technician's full daily schedule as it exists in the system. 



[ ] The summary response must include the following key details:

Total number of jobs for the day.

The name or address of the first customer.

The name or address of the last customer.

[ ] The summary is delivered in a clear, easy-to-understand conversational format. 


[ ] The system must process the request and provide the summary with minimal latency to ensure a seamless user experience in the field. 

Out of Scope

Real-time traffic or travel time estimates: The summary will not calculate or include travel time between jobs for the MVP. 


Complex schedule modifications: The assistant will not support actions like rescheduling or reordering jobs from this summary view. 

Summaries for other technicians or dates: The feature will only provide summaries for the logged-in user's current day.


Language customization: The feature will operate in standard English only for the initial release. 

Dependencies

Third-Party AI Model Integration: The feature requires a successful and stable integration with the selected third-party AI model capable of Natural Language Processing. 



RealGreen Mobile Data Access: The AI backend must have secure, real-time access to the technician's schedule data from the core RealGreen platform. 


Internet Connectivity: The AI assistant features require an active internet connection to function; full offline capabilities are not supported in this phase. 

Notes/Design Considerations

Prompt Engineering: Significant testing and refinement of the prompts sent to the AI model will be required to ensure summaries are consistently accurate, concise, and relevant for technicians. 



Voice User Interface (VUI): The voice recognition component should be tested in various real-world conditions (e.g., vehicle noise, outdoor environments) to ensure high accuracy for command interpretation.
